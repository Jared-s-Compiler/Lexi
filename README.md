# Lexi

A simple lexer for the Lenguage Compiler.
It is not intended for this to be used in the actual compiler, as it *is* and *will* not be interoperable with [Lexus](https://github.com/JaredsCompiler/Lexus).
This lexer was heavily inspired from the work of the [rply](https://github.com/alex/rply/blob/master/rply/lexer.py) Lexer.
Before the Fall 2020 semester I was tinkering with Python language design and came across this what seemed to be easy implementation to port to C++.
That was anything but the case.
I have no further plans to iterate upon this project and documentation can be found in the same organization [here](https://github.com/JaredsCompiler/Lexi-Documentation).
Unit tests are not included, and this project received an A back in the day so I think I did it right.
Rest in peace Anthony Le, you are missed by many.
